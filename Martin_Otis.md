I have over 16 years of web development experience including web site planning and implementation, as well as engagements in the greater WordPress community. I was actively involved in the testing and development of WordPress Core Version 3.0 for the WordPress Core Development Team, have authored WordPress plug-ins and themes and continue to remain engaged in helping others learn the platform by participating in discussions in the online WordPress Forums.

I received Bachelor of Science degrees in both Art History and Studio Art from Knox College—where I also studied philosophy under the guidance of Visiting Professor Susan Sontag.

When not developing websites or brands for wines and spirits, I spend an inordinate amount of time foraging for wild edibles and devising tasty recipes for the table using them.
